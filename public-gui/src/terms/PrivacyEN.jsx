                    An eduID account is a digital identity of the user offered and managed by SURF, which can be used in
                    the
                    field of education and research. Any person can create an eduID account, regardless of whether this

                    who is the controller.<br/>
                    SURF is the controller for several purposes. SURF ensures a lawful basis for processing personal

                            You can add this data to your eduID by linking your eduID to an external data source, such

                            educational institution, bank or national eID. For example your name as known to the
                            institution, your
                            relationship with the institution (e.g. student or employee) and the organization name.
                            Providing these
                            personal data to eduID is done under the responsibility of the institution. <br/>

                <p className="info">
                    eduID only provides your personal data to third parties if this is necessary for you to access the
                    application.
                    For example, eduID provides data to applications to which you log in via eduID. The first time you
                    log in to an
                    application with eduID, you will see an information screen showing exactly what data is provided to
                    the
                    application. Your data will only be transferred if you agree to this. By closing this window, you
                    can prevent
                    the application from receiving your data. You cannot log in to the application with eduID.

                <p>
                    Via <a href={config.spBaseUrl}>My eduID</a> you can see which services you have logged into with
                    eduID.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We will only provide your data to parties other than the above with your permission unless it is
                    legally
                    required or permitted to provide your data. For example, the police can request data from us in the
                    context
                    of a fraud investigation. SURF is then legally obliged to provide this information.

                    for 6 months, except for the obtained first and/or last name, which will be kept for 6 years. This

                    The retention period for all eduID account data is 5 years after the last time you log in somewhere
                    with your
                    eduID. This period has been chosen because in the process of lifelong development it is expected
                    that there will
                    be periods in which a user does not use his eduID, but that the eduID can become relevant to that
                    person again.
                    In the meantime, eduID will send reminders if the account is in danger of being removed.
