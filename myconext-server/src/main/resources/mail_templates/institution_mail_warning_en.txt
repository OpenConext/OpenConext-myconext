Subject: Tip: use your personal email address

Dear {{name}},

You have created an eduID account using your educational institution's email address. It’s important to know that once you complete your studies, you will likely lose access to that email. This means you could also lose access to your eduID account. 

However, you can continue using your eduID even after graduation. That’s why we recommend using your personal email address. You can update this in the settings on mijn.eduid.nl.

Kind regards, 
Team eduID
