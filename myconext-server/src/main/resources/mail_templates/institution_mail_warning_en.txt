Hi {{name}},

You have created an eduID with your institutional account. If you're using your institution account, and you have
completed your education, you will lose access to your eduID. While you can use your eduID after graduation.
That's why we recommend that you just use your own email. You can change your email address
in the {{mySurfConextURL}} settings of your eduID account
